subtitle: My skills and experiences
---

Hello, my name is Ryan Marsala. I am currently a research assistant for the Colorado School of Mines, advised by Dr. Belviranli, and am pursuing a master's thesis in computer science. I have previously received a double major in electrical engineering and computer science from the Colorado School of Mines, and am interested in low level programming, heterogenous systems and similar topics bridging the software and hardware of electronics. I am also interested in optimization of hardware utilization.

### Skills

I am most experienced with programming in c, c++, python, and bash. My research project and most coursework has required significant use of each language. I have also used linux for most work, and docker for research. Other languages I've used include CUDA, Kotlin, Java, Javascript, PHP, and LabVIEW.

I've also taken many electrical courses and learned about a variety of topics from coloumb's law, to RTL, and have learned various concepts involving the physical and circuit level of technology.

### Research

My research has been primarily focused on developing instruction simulation for novel superconducting architectures. The program focuses on specifying cache parameters under cryogenic conditions, and is attempting to discover novel insights into potential memory configurations to maximize throughput. More information can be found in the research tab.

### Courses

Most of my coursework has been focused on areas that bridge the hardware and software of systems, primarily for baremetal electronics. Notable courses include:
- Parallel Programming
- Graphics Programming
- Embedded Systems
- SEED Lab (robotics)
- Web Programming
- Mobile Programming
- Devices and Circuits

Other courses include Electromagnetics, Signal processing, Feedback Control, 

I am currently taking distributed systems and machine learning, and hope to be able to add those to my list in the future.

More information about what I've learned can be found in their respective tabs under courses.
