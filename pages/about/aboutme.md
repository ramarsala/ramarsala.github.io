Hello, my name is Ryan Marsala. I am currently a research assistant for the Colorado School of Mines, advised by Dr. Belviranli, and am pursuing a master's thesis in computer science. I have previously received a double major in electrical engineering and computer science from the Colorado School of Mines, and am interested in low level programming, heterogenous systems and similar topics bridging the software and hardware of electronics. I am also interested in optimization of hardware utilization.

### Skills

I am most experienced with programming in c, c++, python, and bash. My research project and most coursework has required significant use of each language. I have also used linux for most work, and docker for research. Other languages I've used include CUDA, Kotlin, Java, Javascript, PHP, and LabVIEW.

I've also taken many electrical courses and learned about a variety of topics from coloumb's law, to RTL, and have learned various concepts involving the physical and circuit level of technology.

### Research

My research has been primarily focused on developing instruction simulation for novel superconducting architectures. The program focuses on modeling different cache parameters under cryogenic conditionsto determine instruction latency caused by memory, and is attempting to discover novel insights into potential memory configurations to maximize throughput. More information can be found in the architecture simulation tab under research.

### Internship

I have completed an internship at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab under the supervision of George Michelogiannakis. At the end I have a research paper based on my superconducting ADC noise analysis prepared, which explores the effects of a microarchitecture which can experience unique noise effects not present in standard CMOS systems. More information can be found in the SFQ ADC analysis tab under research.

### Courses

Most of my coursework has been focused on areas that bridge the hardware and software of systems, primarily for baremetal electronics. I have also taken higher level programming courses, such as Android and Web Programming, which focused on higher level design and interfacing with existing libraries and software. Notable courses include:
- Parallel Programming
- Graphics Programming
- Embedded Systems
- SEED Lab (robotics)
- Web Programming
- Mobile Programming

Most of these courses are shown in the relavent pages supporting my experience in the various subjects listed in the projects tab.

Other courses include Distributed Systems, Machine Learning, Electromagnetics, Signal processing, Feedback Control, and Devices and Circuits. In these courses I've learned various methods of abstracting and modeling signals, current and other electrical phenomenon into mathematical models to predict and control behaviors in various ways.

More information about what I've learned can be found under projects.
