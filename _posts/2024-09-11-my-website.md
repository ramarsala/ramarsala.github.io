Welcome to my website! I am planning on using this to showcase my current skillsets, as well as showing progress on my current and future research and projects in future posts. This website contains links to my github and linkedin profiles, and contains information about the previous research, projects and coursework I've completed to convey a better understanding of my expertise. More to come soon!
