After some time serving as a research assistant for my advisor Mehmet Belviranli, I have successfully defended my master's thesis and completed my degree! My thesis was based around the work I did creating a simulator for modeling large-scale superconducting systems. I am also expecting for this work to soon be published in an IEEE conference! This would be my first publication once accepted.

Additionally, I had completed my internship at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab under the supervision of George Michelogiannakis. At the end I have a research paper based on my superconducting ADC noise analysis prepared. I am also hoping this paper will be accepted at another IEEE conference! My hope is that I will have two publications accepted by the beginning of next year.

In a few weeks I will be available for hire, and I hope to meet with companies at my college's career fair for oppurtunities to continue similar work based on my past experiences.
